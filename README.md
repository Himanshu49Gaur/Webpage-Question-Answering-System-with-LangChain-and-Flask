# Webpage-Question-Answering-System-with-LangChain-and-Flask
This project demonstrates a simple Flask API that fetches a webpage, processes the content into text chunks, generates embeddings for those chunks using Hugging Face models, stores them in a FAISS vector store, and enables querying through a question-answering (QA) system powered by LangChain.
